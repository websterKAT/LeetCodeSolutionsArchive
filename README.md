# LeetCode Solutions Archive

Welcome to the LeetCode Solutions Archive, a comprehensive repository where I store all my solutions to LeetCode problems. This repository is organized by difficulty level and covers a wide range of topics, including algorithms, data structures, and coding best practices.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main folders based on the difficulty of the problems:

- **Easy/**
- **Medium/**
- **Hard/**

Each folder contains subfolders named after specific LeetCode problems. Each problem folder includes:

- A solution file in one or more programming languages (e.g., `solution.js`, `solution.py`, `solution.java`, `solution.cpp`, `solution.rs`, `solution.go`)
- A `README.md` file that provides a problem description and an explanation of the solution approach.

## How to Use This Repository

- To find a solution, navigate to the folder that matches the difficulty level of the problem you are interested in.
- Inside the difficulty level folder, look for the problem by its number or title.
- Review the `README.md` for a detailed explanation of the problem and the solution.

## Contributing

While this is a personal archive of my LeetCode solutions, contributions are welcome. If you have an alternative solution to a problem or an improvement to an existing solution, please feel free to submit a pull request.
